Welcome!

My name is François Leon, I'm based in Paris and I'm working on Microsoft technologies since almost 20 years now. I had the chance to play with AD, SCOM, SCCM, Skype, Exchange, Sharepoint, Office 365 and now Azure. During this journey, I've also discovered Powershell that I use on daily basis since V2.

This Github Page give a me place where I will be able to share topics I want to share with people, I hope it will help someone one day :).

Cheers
